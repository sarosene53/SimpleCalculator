# 🧮 Simple Calculator with Create React App

Welcome to the **Simple Calculator App**! This project is a beginner-friendly React app, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) 🎉. It’s designed to help you understand the basics of React without using hooks. The app features a clean calculator interface for basic arithmetic operations, with a responsive and dynamic design.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get this project running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Copy the repository to your local system.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to your project folder and run:
  npm install
3. **Start the App**: Start the development server:
  npm start

Your app will automatically open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 🛠️ App Overview
The main components of this app are:

- **index.js**: The entry point of our React application, responsible for rendering our SimpleCalculator component.
- **SimpleCalculator.js**: A standalone component that contains the calculator logic, layout, and design. This component keeps track of input values and performs basic arithmetic operations.

## 🌟 Features
- **Simple, User-Friendly Calculator**: Perform basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The result updates automatically as you enter new values or choose different operations.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled for both desktop and mobile usage, making it functional on any device.

## 📜 Available Scripts

Within the project directory, you can run these scripts:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it. Any edits you make to the source files will automatically reload the page 🔄.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode, allowing you to monitor for issues as you develop 🔍.

### `npm run build`
Generates an optimized production-ready build in the `build` folder 📦.  
The app is then bundled and minified, making it ready for deployment.

### `npm run eject`
⚠️ **Warning**: This is a one-way operation! Once you run `eject`, you’ll have full control over all configuration files, but you won’t be able to go back.

## 📂 Code Structure

The app is structured as follows:

- **index.js**: Initializes the app and renders the `SimpleCalculator` component.
- **SimpleCalculator.js**: Contains the UI and basic functionality for the calculator. It includes:
  - Input Box for 2 numbers 🔢
  - Operation buttons for +, -, *, and /
  - Display screen to show the current input or calculation result
  - Clear button to reset the calculator 🧹

## 🌍 Deployment

The app is ready to be deployed once you run `npm run build`, which will create a production build optimized for the web. For more information, refer to the [Create React App deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).
